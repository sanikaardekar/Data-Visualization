Conclusions: <br>
1. even though Twirl's brand ranking among various considered age groups isn't the highest it wins the most popular brand type <br>
2. Dairy milk is very popular with the ages 65+ which states that the older generation enjoys soft and less fancy chocolates. <br>
3. Crunchie could make some changes in representing their brand, for example: packaging with more panache since the 18-24 ages would be quickly drawn in <br>
4. KitKat is going very well with their 'have a break' campaign which resonates with their brand ranking. <br><br>
