# Tableau Projects <br><br>
Project 1 : Chocolate Brand Popularity Data Viz <br>
Link to the Dashboard: https://t.co/UkurrESp8Q   <br>
Conclusions: <br>
1. even though Twirl's brand ranking among various considered age groups isn't the highest it wins the most popular brand type <br>
2. Dairy milk is very popular with the ages 65+ which states that the older generation enjoys soft and less fancy chocolates. <br>
3. Crunchie could make some changes in representing their brand, for example: packaging with more panache since the 18-24 ages would be quickly drawn in <br>
4. KitKat is going very well with their 'have a break' campaign which resonates with their brand ranking. <br><br>

Project 7 : Connected Scatterplot for fuel price and travel in the US (WoW challenge week 31)<br>
Link to Dashboard : http://bit.ly/3A5VQ1y <br>
Description: I learnt and used plotlyJS to make this visualisation. The dataset used is from demo data. 
A connected scatterplot is a combination of a line plot and a scatterplot. They help us summarize trends and label them as required. <br><br>
Project 8: Hotel Revenue, trends analysis {SQL +Power BI}<br>
Link to Dashboard : http://bit.ly/3O5WLoy<br>
Description: I used a demo excel file which contains data on two types of hotels. I used SQL commands to import the data into Power BI. I used SQL queries like SELECT, LEFT JOIN, and GROUP BY for this project. <br>
I focused on three main questions for arriving at my dashboard:<br>
1) is the hotel revenue growing by year? <br>
→ we have two types of hotel types so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type and analyse<br>
2) should we increase our parking lot size?<br>
→ the parking percentage is roughly the same in 2018 and 2019 and hence it is difficult to determine if increasing parking space would be a good option or not.<br>
3) Explore trends in data and display facts and figures<br>
→ interactive dashboard <br>
